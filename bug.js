In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't updating correctly in Realtime Database.  The `on('value', callback)` method was being called repeatedly, leading to duplicated data and unexpected behavior. This happened only when a certain condition was met in my client-side code. I've isolated the problem to this section of my code: 

```javascript
const ref = firebase.database().ref('myData');
ref.on('value', (snapshot) => {
  const data = snapshot.val();
  if (data) { //Problem happens here when data isn't null initially, resulting in multiple identical values being written
    //Process and update data
    ref.update(newData);
  }
});
```
The `ref.update()` call inside the `on('value')` callback was being triggered multiple times, leading to redundant data updates. This was intermittent and only occurred under a specific set of circumstances, making debugging particularly challenging.
