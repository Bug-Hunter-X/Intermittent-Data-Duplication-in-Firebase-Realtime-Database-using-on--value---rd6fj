The solution is to avoid using `on('value')` inside a function that also updates the database.  The callback repeatedly triggers `ref.update()`, causing data duplication. A more reliable approach is to use `once('value')` to read the data initially and then update as needed:

```javascript
const ref = firebase.database().ref('myData');
ref.once('value', (snapshot) => {
  const data = snapshot.val();
  if (data) {
    // Process data
    const newData = {...}; // Your data processing here
    ref.update(newData);
  } else {
    // Handle case where initial data is null
    console.log("Initial data is null"); 
  }
});
```
This revised code fetches the data only once and then performs the update.  This eliminates the possibility of multiple updates and solves the data duplication problem.  This method is more efficient and reliable than the original implementation.
